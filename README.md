# Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins. This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera. 

## Milestone_2
Using Teachable Machines, I have created an image project model with four classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and None.
I'm now supposed to write about how I will use this model for my project, but to be honest I don't know yet, because there is no explanation in the project overview and I can't look ahead at the tasks because they are locked.
